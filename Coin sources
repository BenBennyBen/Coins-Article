Coin sources of publication are: area studies, site reports, museum collections, mint catalogues, time-period studies.
Some instances of these of course will collate from others but all can be sources of new publications.
Area studies obviously create areas with more or less information, and the approach of each area study determines which coins are found and published.
Site reports provide the greatest density of coins. They also provide an un-matchable picture of contemporary circulations. The bias mainly comes from which sites are able to be / actually investigated. But this bias is explicit and is lessening as a range of sites are investigated.
Museum catalogues are subject to a hidden bias in that the acquisition of pieces is often selective and at least partly undocumented. Private collections in particular are problematic.
Mint catalogues can be useful for giving an impression of the circulation from one mint but are still vulnerable to the methods used to find coins that can create selective results.
Time-period studies are not consistent across time and report those known to a particular investigator.
Each of these studies can create a misleading impression of coins if viewed on the basis of one of the other modes of analysis.
